# LogicPlayJS

Welcome to **LogicPlayJS**, an educational project designed to teach programming logic through a fun and interactive number-guessing game built with JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your foundational skills, this project offers a hands-on approach to learning programming concepts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Players guess a secret number, receiving hints on whether their guesses are too high or too low.
- **Interactive Feedback:** Real-time alerts and prompts guide players to improve their logic.
- **Clean and Responsive Design:** Styled with modern CSS, ensuring a visually appealing experience across devices.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the game layout.
- **CSS3:** A responsive design with gradients, shadows, and images for an immersive feel.

### Backend Logic
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Core game mechanics, including:
  - Random number generation.
  - Input handling with `prompt` and `alert`.
  - Conditional logic for game progression.
  - Looping constructs for repeated guessing.

---

## 💡 Programming Techniques

1. **Conditionals and Comparisons**
   - Used `if-else` statements to evaluate player input and provide feedback.
2. **Loops and Attempts**
   - Implemented a `while` loop to allow repeated guesses until the correct number is found.
3. **String Concatenation**
   - Dynamic messages guide the player, adjusting based on their guesses.
4. **Code Modularity**
   - Clear and descriptive variable names, making the code easy to understand and maintain.
5. **Randomization**
   - Generated the secret number using `Math.random()` to ensure unique gameplay.
